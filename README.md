Nebiyu D. Nebiyeleul's Personal Developer Portfolio 🎨🎨🎨

**Description**

A modern portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills. Built with React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with Three.js to create interactive 3D elements.

**Why I Built This Project**

I wanted to create a unique online presence that not only showcases my work but also demonstrates my love for physics and space, my skills in front-end development, design, and interactive 3D effects. This project allowed me to combine creativity with technical learning.
